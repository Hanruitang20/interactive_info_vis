            <p>
              In designing the floral clock, I sought to express the rhythm of time through the form of natural growth. 
              The number of petals changes with the minutes, symbolizing the unfolding of the day; in the afternoon, petals gradually diminish and darken in color, reflecting the passage of time and the waning of daily energy. 
              This design prompted me to consider time not merely as a mechanical measurement, but as a dynamic, living process. 
              The final piece achieves a visually clean and gentle aesthetic, intuitively showcasing the contrast between AM and PM. 
              I believe further refinement could be achieved by incorporating a more natural petal-fall animation. 
              This would enhance the flower's sense of “breathing” and amplify the emotional expression of time.

          <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Sketch Narrative: </h3>
          <p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
          Designed for users who need to sense the rhythm of time, such as students or office workers. The flower symbolizes the natural cycle of time, blooming in the morning and wilting in the afternoon, conveying a visual representation of the day's energy fluctuations.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong><br>
          I used pink petals and green leaves to express softness and vitality; petals gradually increase during AM hours and fall during PM hours, creating a “breathing sensation” of time. Real-time Seattle time is displayed below the flower for precise reference. The layout remains clean, with a central dot representing the core of time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Future work:</strong><br>
          Dynamic shadows and petal-fall animations could be added to make the transition between day and night more natural and fluid.

            <p>
              The Gas Clock draws inspiration from “breathing” and “emotional rhythms.” 
              I wanted to transform the passage of time from something tense into a rhythmic, perceptible experience of relaxation. 
              Heart-shaped balloons represent the accumulation of each minute, pulsing and expanding with every second like breath. 
              The background's warm-to-cool gradient expresses the emotional shifts from dawn to dusk. 
              I believe this design successfully merges “time” with “feeling,” allowing viewers to visually experience rhythm and tranquility. 
              For future refinement, I aim to disperse the balloons more widely and fade out older balloons over time, creating a more open spatial feel.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Sketch Narrative: </h3>
          <p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
          Designed for users seeking stress relief or breath regulation through visual rhythm. Each heart balloon represents the passage of time and breathing cadence.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong><br>
          I linked seconds to the balloon's breathing animation, creating a subtle visual rhythm of expansion and contraction. Hourly shifts are distinguished by background color temperature: warm tones for morning, transitioning to cool hues in the afternoon, symbolizing the emotional temperature of time. The bottom displays real-time Seattle time to enhance the sense of time and precision.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Future work:</strong><br>
          Mouse interaction could be added, allowing users to click to generate new balloons or alter breathing frequency, making the experience more immersive.

              The design goal of the Meditation Focus Clock is to provide a quiet countdown experience for focused learning or meditation. 
              The circular ripples symbolize the expansion of breath and state of mind. 
              As time progresses, the ripples gradually deepen and the central circle shrinks, representing the process of inner calm gradually taking hold. 
              I chose to omit real-time clock displays to avoid distractions, allowing users to focus more intently on the rhythmic shifts of the present moment. 
              This design maintains visual simplicity and a gentle cadence, aligning well with the concept that “time is an experience.” 
              I envision future iterations incorporating soft audio cues or a halo effect at the conclusion to enhance the immersive and soothing quality of the entire countdown process.

          <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Sketch Narrative: </h3>
          <p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
          A countdown tool designed for users requiring deep focus during study or work, ideal for meditation or the Pomodoro Technique.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong><br>
          I designed selectable durations (1/10/25/55/75 min). The countdown visualizes the passage of focus time through a shrinking ring and expanding water ripples. Colors transition from light to dark, symbolizing a gradually calming mindset. Removed real-time clock display to maintain visual tranquility and focus.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Future work:</strong><br>
          Future iterations could incorporate subtle sound effects or vibration cues to deliver gentler, more natural reminders when focus ends.
